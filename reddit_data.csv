Most people using the phrase recognize that this is not the *intent* of implementing security checks (to deliberately pretend it is more secure than it is) but rather the unintended outcome of inadequacies in equipment, processes, human training etc.

You had a bad experience at security. It happens. What you described certainly wasn't normal. Frankly, it sounds like it was handled professionally. I've never seen the explosive sensor trigger. In your case it did. That's unusual. The staff retested you, escalated you and ultimately let you into the airport being satisfied based on their searching that you weren't a threat.

A big factor of airport security is mostly a show (deterrent), there's no denying this, but it's also based on probabilities. People trying to get stuff through are generally more stressed and make small mistakes such as forgetting to remove liquids.

Yes unless randomly checked.

Most bags aren't scanned for explosive residue. It's done at random/on bags otherwise stopped for a more intensive search.

You could have an interesting conversation on whether that constitutes ""security theatre"" though. Are you suggesting that it's only good security if *every single person* has *every single bag* tested for explosive residue? What about their clothes? This would be completely impractical.

So, should they test *nobody ever for explosive residue under any circumstances*?

If not, who? When? How? These are all real challenges involved in setting up security infrastructure and to some extent there are trade offs made and risk mitigation versus cost in both equipment and time.

FWIW I personally don't buy the ""security theatre"" argument in full. Yes it's frustrating a lot of the time, but if you ever read up on the history of airplane hijackings the history is *wild*. People used to hijack planes *all the time* in the 1970s.

3. It can be different rules entirely sometimes for example if someone from head office is in once a week etc.

The same as the aforementioned legal highs and nos bans. Will it reduce the harm it's doing? Absolutely. You're never going to stop these things completely because addicts will always find a way to get their fix.

In the UK, 20 is a reasonable temperature, 25 is pretty warm and 30 is about as hot as it gets a few days a year (if we're lucky).

So people in the UK are always grateful for sunny weather as it's by no means a given, even during the summer. We have years when the summer is a washout and you'll therefore make most of sunny weather whenever it happens, even in colder months. I live in the South and can imagine this trend only increases as you head up North, where there will be less sunshine in winter months.

As such, we're better adapted for cold damp grey weather rather than endless sunshine.

By contrast, when I lived in Madrid, it was a steady 35 degrees the whole of the summer and it was a given that the weather would be good in the summer.

I never said it was expected in the same way, but it IS expected in different ways. 

Sorry but you are arguing against something I didn't say. And the top comment of this thread said ""tipping is not a thing unless the service is EXCEPTIONAL"" 

That's plainly not true: post Covid, you frequently see a service charge automatically added. Ditto large tables. Ditto table service venues. 

Last night i had a distinctly average meal (a bit of liquorice stick found it's way into my cabbage slaw, my first wine glass was covered in fingerprints, and our tap water tasted like it had leftover cordial or soap in it) and they slapped a service charge on as default, which we paid anyway because the experience wasn't dreadful and they corrected the mistakes. 

>Have you ever been to the US? 

No. I've been to Canada where a 20% tip is similarly expected to the edge of mandatory. Had a fight with my then-girlfriend about it once because she majorly pissed off a server by not tipping.

She even told me on arrival that a tip was expected but then broke her own rule because it was table service of expensive cocktails rather than table service of food. 

I've also been to Iceland (tipping doesn't really happen because unions mean good pay), Portugal (basic tip expected like UK), France (ditto), New Zealand (again, similar to UK), Greece (yuh huh), Cuba (yup. wanted any extra CUCs/Pesos going, begging was everywhere too), and Italy (same). 

So I don't know where you're going but wherever I've been, with the exception of Iceland, where they get union backed pay rises every year, people who serve you expect a tip. 

And in several American countries it is verging on mandatory.",AskUK,1700902906.0,1700902906.0

He may die after a blackout in the car, there would would be an investigation and who knows if any life insurance including on the mortgage will pay out. How much money will the family be left with in that case?

What would the impact on his career if he got a conviction for dangerous driving (I guess he would have to declare the conviction to any future employer for *n* years ) plus a driving ban for a year or two plus an extended retest? Even after that he will have much more expensive car insurance. 

What would the impact on his career if avoided procession but it just got reported?

He is running the risk of delaying treatment. Will that make a difference to the effectiveness of treatment?

His choices may mean that his kid will grow up without a father and perhaps with a less financially comfortable life.

 Does he have private medical insurance through his employer? That at least would reduce the wait time if refereed to a specialist.

835,t3_182zpea,severedsolo,kaof36e,">Literally why would anyone get a disposable?

Because if you don't really know anything about vapes they are an easy gateway. 

You'e absolutely right the Elfbar reusables are exactly the same, but I didn't know that at the time. 

My perception of vaping was that it was quite complicated, people talking about coils and meshes and oils and such. Then one day I was in Home Bargains and they were selling disposables at the till. Half the price of a pack of fags so I went ""huh why not"". (This was only about a month ago mind)

Used them up, bought a couple more disposables mixed in with occasionally still buying cigarettes until I found myself basically using the vape and not wanting to buy ciggys. 

Then I started looking into it a bit further and realised the pods were half the price of a disposable and it's exactly the same, so I switched to them full time.

I 100% agree they are wasteful, but I probably wouldn't have made that jump without an ""easy"" option to ease me into it. 

I think the answer is probably have the rechargable Elfbars replace the disposable ones. You still get that ""easy access"" for people like me, but you can just go and buy another pod rather than a whole new disposable. 

And obviously tighten up on selling them to kids.",AskUK,1700904067.0,1700904067.0

Reality is people go to court, and suddenly get released with nothing. Happened to a close relative of ours. They were in jail, lost all their stuff/ID/accommodation/any clothing etc when they ended up in Jail. On their first court day the judge basically called into question something or other (not sure what, total lay person here), and suddenly said He was released on time served. 

We were expecting a multi day court case. He was kept at the court jail with his prison jacket and clothes 8 hours because no one expected him to be released, and they couldn't send him back to jail to get his stuff. So someone had to bring his stuff over to the court jail. Then right at the end after a lot of push from various solicitors (because we had to wait the entire time for him upstairs, and they were constantly seeing us and trying to find out for us what was going on) they eventually got his stuff to him, and he was brought upstairs and basically told to come back tomorrow to talk to probation about stuff/accommodation, and good luck. 

He was kicked out the courts at 5pm with his prison stuff, no ID, nothing, not even a blanket on the coldest night of the year in an ice storm. 

He didn't know we were coming to see him/his case. We immediately bought him a phone, because he had nothing, and I found a shelter round the corner who basically sighed, and said that happened a lot. We got him located in there and they managed to give him a jacket and hat and gloves and because it was a very bad weather period they allowed extras to sleep on the floor, else they'd freeze to death outside. 

We got stranded down there due to the weather for a few days, so we were able to mentor him somewhat for a few days. He said had we not been there, he would've committed whatever crime he could've just to get back inside for a bed and to not die. 

He did make it, he was an older gentleman, so more help opened up once he managed to get past the first couple weeks being homeless and was supported into proper accommodation and health support. He's been out for several years now and is doing well, but for someone who mistakenly believed that everyone would be taken care of, it was a massive wake up call as to what happens that most people don't see.",AskUK,1700904242.0,1700904242.0

 Sometimes I don't pass out either and it's more like I'm staring into space trying to talk myself out of it but not really being able to talk aloud, like I'm very much in my head, which can happen a few times in the days following up to passing out.  Have passed out only twice, but luckily I have felt fine after passing out, just a little shaken and confused for a few seconds. Once I have passed out, that seems to be it done until next time.

That also explains why the ECG has been normal after it was taken after the episodes! There has been no follow up after this, just like ""you're fine be free."" I think I need to have another conversation with a doctor.

1019,t3_183c74o,__Night_Hawk__,kaohe24,"Worked in and around this area. There's several things that can be done. If the prisoner is high risk (think the violent and dangerous ones) then they can do a residency in a hostel called an approved premises (also known as probation hostel, halfway house) for a limited amount of time. They're on constant watch in there and have strict curfews etc.

Following that, or if not high risk, some areas in the UK have some sort of housing sorted by Probation that is usually short term (again like 3 months) in a shared HMO situation.

Usually during this time (in either of the above) they have homeless assessments complete by the local authority who will then help them move on to other accommodation, particularly if they have a priority need based on disability, mental health, care leavers, etc. Obviously there's a lot of people in the prison system who fit that criteria. Some local authorities put homeless people in cheap hotels (temporary accommodation) whilst assessments are carried out or they find somewhere suitable.

During this time they can also explore private rented accommodation, things can improve with family, they can live in supported accommodation or can work with local housing organisations.

There's also rehabs available for those willing to engage and where available, but rare. 

However I have seen some issues where the above housing options are not available due to the massive demand on prisons atm - they're trying to get people out as quickly as possible. In those situations sometimes they can facilitate homeless assessment via phone in prison but not often. There's also people who are just unsuitable for those above housing options for various reasons including previous violence to housing workers, arson behaviour/convictions, etc. In all these situations they just get released homeless and have to engage with the local homeless charities/connections to get them accommodation (some councils do schemes to get rough sleepers off the street) or basic shelter and food.

The problem is there's a lot of issues with being released homeless. Some commit offences for money to survive (robbery, burglary, drug dealing). And some are more risky when homeless (sex offenders, domestic abusers who will attempt to go back to the family home). In those situations it unfortunately does result in people committing new offences and getting new convictions/being recalled back to custody. There's also people who are themselves more at risk if homeless (victimisation from sexual/domestic abuse, overdose risk, health conditions, etc).",AskUK,1700905890.0,1700905890.0

As a registrant I‚Äôm obligated to stop if there is an accident or incident and I could be of help. 

I was travelling to a very very important meeting and came across a car accident, I thought I could see a member of the public doing chest compressions do jumped out of my car and went to help. Turns out it was a first-aider putting the patient in the recovery position. She handed over to me and quickly disappeared. The gentleman had cut his head open on the windscreen in the crash, I cleaned and dressed his wound, assessed him and decided to immobilise him while we waited a few hours for an ambulance.

I also found two different women face down on the ground about two hours apart in the same place. One I helped up and home, the other had clearly broken her ankle so got her into a vehicle and off to a&e. 

I also found a pretty bad car accident with 4 casualties and helped out. There were no paramedic crews available apart from solo paramedic in a car. I ended up spending a couple of hours in the smashed up car, taking vital signs, stabilising a fracture and helping administer pain relief to the casualty stuck in the vehicle while the fire crew cut him out of the car.

One is a sexual attraction to preteens, the other is rape

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre not suggesting we lock someone up for their sexual preference regardless of if they act on their desires‚Ä¶. We‚Äôve moved past that kind of judgement, right? üíÄ

I am a social worker who helps to rehabilitate convicted sex offenders

What a lot of people don‚Äôt understand, is that there is no such thing as a bad person, in the 10 years that I have been working with sex offenders, have never met someone and thought  ‚Äú my God you are evil‚Äù

When people commit crimes, they are attempting to achieve a goal in life, that all humans try to achieve.

This could be a relationship, meeting the sexual needs, financial stability, creativity, general, happiness, etc

But they do it in a way that is not considered healthy or safe, thus, illegal. In scotland, we put paedophiles and child molesters through a group therapy program that identifies the goals they were trying to achieve in their offending, and why they chose that particular route to achieve the goal.

Then we can help teach them a healthy way to achieve the goal.

This would include building up their self esteem, helping them to get jobs, teaching them how to flirt without breaking the law.



Some people, yes, need to be in prison, but if they are released, that is because we are confident that they can reintegrate into society safely

People who commit claims have a mental illness, they need help, and after they get that they shouldn‚Äôt continue to be punished for the rest of their life for the mistakes they made while they were unwell.

Helping, rather than punishing, comes with the added benefit of making them more likely to seek help, rather than hurting people. This idea that people should be punished for the rest of their lives for the mistakes only encourages people with problems to continue hunting, people and secret

This is only for my curiosity so don't answer if you don't want to share, but - was there ever anything structurally wrong with your heart ie abnormal echo/cardiac MRI - ie something that would cause a conduction problem on its own?

Cos if not, I wonder if the collapses were due to some kind of big parasympathetic nervous system discharge (that's what slows your heart down, and in theory a very active parasympathetic discharge can cause a short pause). And then what you're feeling now is an aura from the other effects of that parasympathetic activity - but not the faint as your pacemaker kicks in and stops your heart rate from dropping.

I only had winter clothes for some reason and needed something a bit light for summer and these were the ideal material and like...weight? Not too heavy or anything, just ideal.

Now, Tesco, I have to say, makes pretty sturdy clothing but they were on like a double sale so I'm thinking, they'll fall apart inside a year but they're cheap as chips, fun, nice deep blue colour (and most of my clothes are black so that was a nice bonus, pop of colour!) , they're a bit too big but I'm lucky enough to have a build that it'll wort of work, it'll sort fo look intentional?

&#x200B;

I just needed something to get me through the summer, with this idea I'd replace them when they INEVITABLY fell apart around me.

&#x200B;

....mates, listen. We're 5 years in. These absolute HEROES of a pair of kecks are going strong.

They've admittedly, sort of by accident, become my work trousers, I'm a gardener and they're this light canvasy material that is ideal for summer, lets the breeze through. Because they're oversized, in winter I can layer underneath them.

No word of a lie, I run around in mud, rain, sleet, slow, I climb walls and trees in these trousers, I wear them TO THE DEATH, they get damp, muddy, filthy and are heavily washed once a week....

They should be rotting to bits. Should be falling apart at the seams. Should be mere rags b'now.

....nope.

....flawless. I mean, literally....not so much as a pulled stitch, no tears, no holes, nothing just worn out through sheer friction. Not even stretches....nothing....nothing wrong. 

I can't make sense of it, these are just canvasy kecks, nothing special, on sale in the most 'these are just cheap trash' way I've ever seen?

&#x200B;

They're fucking indestructable. Cool in summer, warm in winter, comfortable ALL the time, never too tight or too big, deep pockets (which as a woman, is a godsend) so I can carry my phone, my vape, my keeps, and...like, I have the room! 

 So excellent that I've been tempted to cycle them back into regular wear, do a few deep washes, maybe dye them black and put them back on the roster for wearing to go out, because they're are and remain....like my relationshop woih them has become the most stable and secure IN MY LIFE. 

They never let me down. Undamaged after YEARS of the kind of wear that should have rotted them.

They're also blue, high waisted and sort of bunch around the middle, and I wear them with Doc Martens, bloused at the ankle(tucked in, like i'm military) so now and again i look like I'm out of DragonBall Z, which is just....delightful for myself and others, lol",AskUK,1700910186.0,1700910186.0

1604,t3_183foal,Teembeau,kaonkpz,"The problem is that trains are run by government, and because no-one in government really owns rail, they don't really give a toss if you use it or not.

The thing with capitalists who own Easyjet, Ryanair, National Express is that they want to make money. That means getting you to use their services and to come back next time because it worked for you.

So, the reason you can fly to Edinburgh so cheaply is that Easyjet don't want empty seats. An empty seat means no money. ¬£20 means they perhaps make a fiver. ¬£5 is better than ¬£0. There are times/days when you won't get that for ¬£20, though. Rail just isn't this smart because it's run by bureaucrats who really don't care if you ride or not. They still get paid regardless of whether a seat is used or not.

So, late night trains from Swindon to London are pretty much empty. They charge ¬£50. If they charged ¬£20 they'd probably make more money as people would go for nights out to the West End, instead of driving in with their family because filling a car is much cheaper.

But this is also why overcrowding of some off-peak trains can happen. Because the prices aren't raised for high demand trains. So you turn up and you're on with all the rugby fans.

They absolutely did and do. The difference is in the equipment you're using. When people were using turntables they were usually using them with decent amplifiers and speakers, and this was bringing out the full richness of the sound. Then when you go to CDs, you're usually listening to them on equipment that's not as good, or leaving the EQ at a generic baseline level.

I love old audio equipment and play with tape a lot - good hardware, good tape, good sound, I'm not one of those who uses a shoebox recorder and naff cassettes to *mAkE mIxTaPeS* \- but that's just because I like to play with old stuff, but I can't say older is better. Tape and vinyl are good, but they are not as good as CD audio. CD audio records at a higher resolution that our ears can discern; the recordings are, to all *human* intents and purposes, perfect.

As these fares are subsidised, as they increase, the fare payer will absorb the larger part of the increase.  If tax previously subsidised 50% of the tickets and prices double, it seems like the price has tripled from a fare payer perspective.  

If we look at the 21/22 financial data, we can see that these companies made a combined loss of ¬£1.5Bn as turnover dropped by 1% but costs increased by 4%.  https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/statistics/finance/rail-industry-finance/

The Govt is also under pressure from the rail companies to make sure that this figure is as high as possible, and they are willing to do so because they are investors so higher prices  = more money in their own pockets. 

Other countries invest in our rail networks, and the profit from those investments goes towards funding their own rail infrastructure and to keep costs down, so not only are we paying extortionate rates for our own tickets, we're subsidising the tickets of EU countries that are significant shareholders in our ""for profit"" rail networks. 

They quite literally laugh at us for it.   


If the Rail networks are brought back under Government control (not this particular shower of cunts, clearly) then the external pressures are eased, and it can be run in tandem with Network Rail and with a neutral fiscal imperative. 

Prices would drop, services would get better, abusive rail unions would be made obsolete, working for rail companies would be far more attractive because of the Govt pension and protections etc..

It would also be a working tax reduction, because every single person that uses public transport to get to work would be getting a pay rise and that money goes into stimulating the economy.

I looked on Twitter to see if this was just my route, only to see dozens of people saying their route had lost all advance tickets, even when people put in a date two months in the future. The response people were getting was that the off peak/anytime ticket rises were a fair increase in line with the annual fare raise, completely ignoring any reference to the advance tickets vanishing without a trace. People noticed that weekend travel still had the advance fares, and a lot of complaints were raised about the company going after commuters who almost certainly couldn't change from using the train, especially with no notice.

The silver lining was that after around two weeks, the advance fares were back, albeit increased, so I'm now paying ¬£9.70 a day.

You're neglecting the fact that outsourcing and privatizing the railway drove insane costs to undertake any projects or maintenance works. 

The cost of running the railway influences the cost to those who use it. 

All I've heard from being in the industry for 10 years by those who are 20+ years my senior, is ""this is nothing like the old British Rail days"". 

Whether it's privatization in practice may be up for debate given the government drives a baseline set of requirements to put a reasonable railway where reasonably possible, but the pricing influence since privatization is very real.",AskUK,1700913874.0,1700913874.0

But it is all under government control. National Rail are a government agency. They decide who they subcontract work to. They decide how much fares should rise, what services should run, and the TOCs are just going to be pure subcontractors soon.

And the main reason why other countries have cheap rail tickets (although, it should be noted that trade unions do a lot of cherry picking), is fat subsidies of trains. SNCF don't run trains more efficiently. The French government just subsidise fares more. So instead of handing over ¬£80 for tickets, it costs ¬£50. But then, ¬£30 is taken from your taxes to pay for it, too. The sum is still the same.

Why do you think more government in this is going to make things better when all the evidence is that private companies run transport better and cheaper? Your car is cheaper than the train. A coach is cheaper than a train. Flights are often cheaper than trains. And none of these get the level of subsidy that trains already get.",AskUK,1700913877.0,1700913877.0

In terms of trains, no, we really don't run it as a business. If trains were run as a business, you'd immediately see a lot of train lines and stations close. Services like the Westbury to Chippenham line where there's about 5 people on a train. You'd see the price of train fares just before Christmas rocket up. You'd have more trains put on for sporting events so the train company could make out like gangbusters from all the extra demand. You'd have more granular pricing of trains, more use of last minute cheap fares to fill empty seats, discounts on 1st class seats at weekends to get an extra tenner out of people. They'd charge for reservations, and especially for reservations on table seats. Ticket offices would be closed down, because it costs a shit load of money to run them for the odd Mrs Miggins who sometimes goes to the next town. You'd see lines connecting Heathrow with the main lines which would be profitable like Heathrow Express is (but for some reason the government is not doing these but is doing the pointless HS2).

Rail is run by politicians who are the worst people to run anything, who have bureaucrats working for them. None of them care about whether rail makes more money because it's not their money. Some guy in charge of National Rail isn't getting a cut of the profits like the CEO of Easyjet does. Which is why Easyjet planes are full. Because they'd rather make ¬£2 on a passenger than have an empty seat.

>Public transport requires subsidy to exist, but the UK's view is it should be self-sustaining. Therefore, prices increase to make up the shortfall of less subsidy, and increasing costs.  The same thing happens with bus services - private companies cut least profitable routes; as council finances are increasingly stretched, subsidised routes are withdrawn.

same goes for any person I know they all went to uni and never went back It's the same story with those towns once the youth turn 18 they all leave for uni.

There's also very little economic trade and high rates of eldery people.

but again the money isn't there to improve the the town so it's just left in a crap condition.

People there have to use foobanks because wages in the area pay poorly.

local employer's can't pay more because there cilents are old people that often pay alot.

same goes for what I did, I left my home town and never went back I mean why would any person stay?

I think also the local hashtags are dead so the business just become shutters they can't attract enough people in the off season so they shut down.

I think the local government also gave up on the town they do help but they couldn't attract any big name employers the barclays went and I think also the wilko went so it's not good.

but again It's a funding problem the money has never been there to improve the town even if ¬£400k was invested its likely been spending on homes for over 55's. 

but city' often attract people that want to work for a better wage. 

city's often offer cheaper rent.

Yes, but treating the ""N word"" as worse than other racial slurs is really a product of American history and culture so it is weird we have followed it. Not that any racial slurs should be used, of course.

I also think it is acceptable to use any word in certain contexts for clarity - e.g. in a discussion like this about what words are acceptable.
