The strikes are on the government, are solely their fault and you should blame them for any harm that happens.\\n\\nLastly, I think you severely underestimate how shit things are - people are currently already at risk. Like ok, you talk about cancer. I shouldn't be diagnosing people with screenable new cancers in the hospital but I am. That's a sign of how overrun services are, of how things are already in shambles. *everyone* is now in the role where any diagnosis is fair play.
